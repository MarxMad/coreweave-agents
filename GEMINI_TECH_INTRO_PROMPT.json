    "prompt": "Create an ultra-futuristic 2-second tech intro for CoreWeave Agents. Start with a black void, then explosive digital particles forming the CoreWeave logo with electric blue (#06b6d4) and purple (#8b5cf6) neon glows. Add holographic grid lines, floating hexagonal UI elements, and pulsing data streams. Include subtle AI neural network patterns in the background with glitch effects. The logo should materialize with a powerful tech sound effect, surrounded by floating geometric shapes and particle systems. Use cinematic lighting with lens flares and chromatic aberration for maximum tech impact. End with the logo fully formed, glowing intensely against a dark tech environment with subtle code rain effects.",
